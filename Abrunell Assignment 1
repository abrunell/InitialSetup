Languages Comparison

	Java and JavaScript are two very popular languages that are used in the world today. Although they have similar names, Java and JavaScript are two very different languages meant for different purposes. In this paper, I will compare and contrast these two languages. 
	
	While Java and JavaScript are both Object Oriented Programming, Java is an OOP “programming” language whereas JavaScript is an OOP “scripting” language. Java is a language that can be used on its own to create standalone applications or webpage applets. Java is used a lot in the world of business for a variety of purposes. However, it is similar to JavaScript in that it is used most often to add functionality to webpages. Java is useful because a program only needs to be written one time, regardless of the different types of hardware that it will run on. This is because Java is compiled into Java bytecode, which is then interpreted by a Java virtual machine that runs on each individual device. Thus, Java applications have a lot of portability. Java has C-like syntax and static typing. 
	
	JavaScript also has C-like syntax and is OOP like Java, but most everything else is different between the languages. JavaScript is incorporated into HTML to enhance webpages. It is an easy language that is loaded as human-readable code, unlike Java which must be compiled into bytecode. JavaScript cannot create standalone applications like Java. Java uses classes for objects, but JavaScript does not have classes. Instead, the functionality is accomplished through object prototypes. JavaScript is a simpler language than Java, and is easier to learn. Typically, a JavaScript program is quite short, and might be used for something simple such as a log-on procedure. 
	
	In conclusion, although Java and JavaScript have similar names, they are very different languages meant for different purposes. They do, however, share some similarities. A programmer might find it useful to know both languages if they often work on developing webpages.
